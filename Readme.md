The lighting can make things look cool.
I'm including three problems because they drove me insane:
The clock always looks dark in Unity for some reason.
The lights are brighter in Unity than on the phone.
Switching the materials from Standard to Mobile/Unlit (supports lightmap) totally screws up the materials. Some of them lost their texture. Switching them back caused everything to be black on the phone. I had to recopy all the art assets from the zip file to get things back to normal.
